                                            Google Sheets Plugin Privacy Statement<br></br>

                                            We have an integration with Google Sheets listed on the Google Workspace Marketplace. This plugin allows users to send WhatsApp Messages to their Contacts from Google Sheets.<br></br>

                                            The plugin’s use and transfer of information received from Google APIs to any other app adheres to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.<br></br>

                                            Our plugin uses a few scopes and below is a justification for the scopes used in our tool –<br></br>

                                            …/auth/script.container.ui  This scope is used to allow users to choose their contact numbers<br></br>

                                            …/auth/script.external_request  This allows users to make API calls to our system that sends WhatsApp messages to their contact list.<br></br>

                                            ./auth/spreadsheets  This scope allows us to read the spreadsheet content that includes phone numbers, names or other variables that they want to send with their WhatsApp Messages<br></br>

                                            …/auth/script.scriptapp  This scope allows users to schedule messages and track responses on Google Sheets<br></br>

                                            Any contacts or data sent from Google Sheets is always stored in the user’s Wati account only, and by no means is it shared with any other user or account.<br></br>
